To compile or run this project, you will need Xcode on your computer. You can clone the repository, or just download the zip file named "spaceship_game.xcodeproj.zip", which should give you all the files and the actual Xcode project. From there, you can just open the Xcode project, select a target/simulator device to run the game and click 'Run' (triangle button) near the top left. 

For picking the device, you can use any device since this works on any screen for both the iPhone and iPad. You can also side load it onto your phone using the following steps:

  3. On the option button for testing (next to the Run button), select your device, which you should connect through a USB cable.
  4. Click "Trust device" on iPhone.
